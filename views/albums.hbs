{{!-- So let's create a new page - albums.hbs where all the results 
will be displayed. Make sure you show the name and the cover of 
each album and add a button/link to see the tracks --}}

{{#each allAlbums}}
    {{ this.name}} <br>

    <img src="{{this.images.0.url}}" alt="artist image" width="200px"> <br>
